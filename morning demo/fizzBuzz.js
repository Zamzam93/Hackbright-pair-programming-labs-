// Write your solution below this line:
To do so, loop from 1 to 50 (inclusive). Each time through, if the number is evenly divisible by 3, say ‘fizz’. If the number is evenly divisible by 5, say ‘buzz’. If the number is evenly divisible by both 3 and 5, say ‘fizzbuzz’. Otherwise, say the number.
//pseudocode:
//iterate over the range 1 to 50, using a for-loop
for (let i = 1; 1 < 51; i++) {

//if true print out "fiz"
//otherwise (else if), check if current number is divisible by 5
if (i % 3 === 0)
  // if true print out "fizz"
  //otherwise, check if current number is divisible by both 3 and 5
   //if trie print "fizzbuz"
 } //else 
  //print out current number
